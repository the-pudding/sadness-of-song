		In 2017, Julia Michaels' hit song "Issues" took the pop world by storm. With
		lyrics like:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"I'm jealous, I'm overzealous / When I'm down, I get real down,"
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		it laid bare the singer's emotional struggles over a catchy, upbeat melody.
		The song marked a striking shift in popular music: a mainstream embrace of
		darker, more negative themes.
	</p>

	<p class="intro-text">
		As it turns out, "Issues" was not an anomaly, but rather a sign of the
		times. Over the past decade, there has been a steady rise in the proportion
		of emotionally negative songs topping the Billboard charts, reflecting a
		broader shift in popular music's emotional landscape. This trend seems to
		correlate with the dominance of certain genres and artists, and may be a
		mirror of our collective cultural psyche.

		To understand this phenomenon, we analyzed the sentiment of every song that
		reached the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 from 1960 to 2020. Using advanced
		language processing, we assigned each song scores for eight basic emotions:
		anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The
		results paint a fascinating picture of the evolving emotional tone of
		popular music.
